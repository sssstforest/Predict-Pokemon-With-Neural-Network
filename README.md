# Predict Pokemon With Simple Feedforward Neural Network
This project uses **Simple Feedforward Neural Network** to Predict **Pokemon** with images.

## Prediction Result

Model Training Accuracy: **0.014**  
Validation Accuracy: **0.008**

## Setup the environment

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Thoughts & Future

1. The prediction is FUNNY :D
2. The simple feedforward NN might perform bad on complex image classification. I will try CNN or other NN structure in the future to complete this project.
